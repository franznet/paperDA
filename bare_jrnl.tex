% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

The objective of this study was to compare different data augmentation techniques applied to volcanic seismic signals. Using the datasets generated by these data augmentation techniques, seismic-volcanic event classification models were trained in order to identify the data augmentation technique that generates the best-performing models.
The datasets generated considered two types of data: real and augmented data that balance the dataset, and datasets with entirely augmented data.
Similarity and diversity metrics were applied to the data generated by the data augmentation techniques in order to analyze these characteristics.

\subsection{The problem of recognition}
The seismic-volcanic signatures are dangerous events that happen unexpectedly, although these present some signals before they happen. In the world, these events are registered continuously by means of seismometers. Afterward, expert geophysicists take these data and classify these signals, task
The seismic-volcanic activity has been studied for many years. Nowadays, this type of activity is registered by sensors that record signals in three dimensions. The seismic-volcanic pattern recognition process in Chile is typically done manually, although there are state-of-the-art studies that it makes automatically form \cite{salazar2022multi,salazar2020deep,malfante2018automatic,bicego2012classification,curilem2016pattern, lara2020automatic}. These studies regularly consider one channel of three available, one station, and one volcano.
In this context, applying Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to the automatic classification of volcanic seismic events has become an interesting approach compared to traditional methods.

\subsection{A summary of methods used in classificaction of volcanic seismic events}
In the analysis and treatment of seismic-volcanic time signals, transformations are regularly considered that allow us to represent the observations in the domains of: time, frequency and cepstral\cite{malfante2018automatic,lara2020automatic}, which consider statistical measures, information theory, among others. Among the methods used for the analysis of this type of signals we have the Hidden Markov model (HMM)\cite{bicego2012classification,beyreuther2012constructing, carniel2014characterization} with its improvements such as the Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMM), the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)\cite{beyreuther2012constructing} in the detection of singularities, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\cite{langer2009synopsis}, and others (HMM-based generative embedding)\cite{bicego2012classification}.
Currently, there are several works that propose the automatic classification of seismic-volcanic signals that consider supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM)\cite{malfante2018automatic,curilem2016pattern,giacco2009support,langer2009synopsis,lara2020automatic,curilem2018improving,malfante2018machine}; Multilayer Perceptron(MLP)\cite{giacco2009support,langer2009synopsis,lara2020automatic}; Random Forest\cite{malfante2018automatic,lara2020automatic,titos2019classification}; Linear Discriminant Analysis\cite{lara2020automatic}; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\cite{titos2019classification,salazar2020deep,curilem2018using}; Temporal Convolutional Neural Network(TCN)\cite{titos2019classification,rodriguez2021bayesian}; Bayesian Neural Networks\cite{bueno2019volcano}; Tensor Learning Framework with Multilinear Principal Component Analysis(MPCA) and Support Tensor Machine(STM)\cite{peixoto2021tensor} techniques on multichannel and multistation data; Scalable Variational Inference for Gaussian Process (SVGP) and Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP)\cite{lopez2020acontribution}; Bag of Words in seismic document classification as a set of seismic words\cite{bicego2015volcano}.
With unsupervised methods we have Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM)\cite{langer2009synopsis,esposito2008unsupervised}, Cluster Analysis(CA)\cite{langer2009synopsis}, Balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies(BIRCH)\cite{duque2020exploring}.
Transfer Learning (TL) was applied in the classification of volcanic seismic events using CNN\cite{mythesismaster,titos2019classification}.
Deep Learning (DL) has been applied to seismic-volcanic signal classification, experimenting with different CNN\cite{mythesismaster} and RNN architectures\cite{salazar2020deep,ferreira2023deep,canario2020indepth}, and through Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP)\cite{lopez2020acontribution}.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) provide real-time tracking capabilities of volcanic activity, even if the seismic sources change over time. It has been applied to seismic-volcanic signal classification, testing several architectures\cite{salazar2020deep}. In detection and classification, the following RNN architectures have been applied: vanilla-RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated-Recurrent Unit (GRU)\cite{titos2018detection}; in \cite{rodriguez2021bayesian} vanilla-RNN and LSTM, in addition to identifying the degree of specialization of the neurons.
Autoencoder (AE) is an excellent unsupervised learning algorithm. AE is considered a nonlinear compression structure to reduce the signal size, dimensionality reduction, towards another latent dimension. In \cite{mythesismaster} various AE architectures generated reconstructed and encoded seismic events, which were classified using different DL and TL model architectures. In \cite{rodriguez2021bayesian} AE is applied to obtain the segmentation mask of the seismic event.
Data Augmentation (DA), which basically deals with the generation of new data from existing data, following some rules and restrictions so that they are considered equally valid as the originals. Amplitude deformation, frequency deformation, noise addition, and horizontal shift were applied to seismic signals \cite{curilem2018using}. In \cite{salazar2022multi} the importance of DA to avoid biased models in the classification of seismic-volcanic events was shown.
In reference to volcanic seismic data, most works consider a single station channel for the classification of volcanic seismic events, but there are already some works that consider several channels and stations \cite{lara2020automatic,curilem2016pattern,maggi2017implementation,ferreira2023deep}. In addition, it is shown that the multi-station scheme is more precise than the single station \cite{titos2019classification,ferreira2023deep}.


\section{Methodology}
Currently, Machine Learning is already used for the Recognition of seismic-volcanic signal patterns.
In fact, our previous researches developed\cite{mythesismaster,salazar2022multi} models that have implemented a new methodology for classifying these types of seismic signals by Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, and spectrograms. The rotation technique was used as a data augmentation technique for avoiding imbalanced data.
The current research on recognizing seismic-volcanic signal patterns will consider data from the three Chilean volcanos. The Millennium Institute on Volcanic Risk Research ‚Äì Ckelar Volcanoes\footnote{\href{https://ckelar.org}{\color{blue}https://ckelar.org}} monitors many of these volcanos by seismic stations provided with triaxial sensors.

The Lascar volcano is located in the north of Chile (23\textdegree22' S, 67 \textdegree44' W; 5592 m a.s.l.), 270 km NE from Antofagasta and 70 km SE from San Pedro de Atacama. The Millennium Institute for Volcanic Risk Research (CKELAR) has been monitoring the area using a network of 11 three-component seismic stations. Short-period 2 Hz seismometers have been continuously monitoring at 200 Hz. The database of signals was built using only the Z channel.

\section{Methods}
We proposed a solution based on transfer learning because this helps to speed up training and improve the performance of the deep learning models \cite{titos2019classification,bueno2019volcano}, in addition to having few examples to generate the model again. For the TL, the pre -trained AlexNet\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} model was considered.
The input data are generated spectrograms of the data labeled (waveforms) of each seismic event class. The processing sequence consists of five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item describe the pre-process that applies to the time series (earthquake);
 \item detail the generation of spectrograms from the earthquakes labeled;
 \item use the data augmentation technique to increase the amount of data in training and test data sets;
 \item the construction of the prediction model; and, finally,
 \item estimate the performance of the model.
\end{enumerate}
The next paragraphs, each step is explained.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pre-processing: The seismometers register data at 200Hz, 500Hz or 100Hz. We resampled at 100Hz each event. Centered the data at mean. Apply the Butterworth-Highpass filter at 1Hz. Then we apply Butterworth-Bandpass filter at frequency between 1Hz to 10Hz. Next step is normalizing the data. This pre-processing task is realized by Obspy python toolbox \cite{beyreuther2010obspy}.
	\item The spectrograms were calculated applying a short-time Fourier transform with formula
$$
S[x(t)](n,k)=\left|\sum_{m=0}^{N-1}x(m)\cdot w(m-n)\cdot e^{i2\pi mk}\right|^2$$
Where x(t) and y(t) represent the seismic signal and short-time Fourier transform sliding window. The sliding window size was set to 1 with a 95\% overlap. The spectrograms generated are images RGB of $224\times224$ pixels.
	\item Data augmentation techniques are considered to avoid unbalanced dataset, and for that reason to avoid biased models. Many data augmentation techniques were implemented, and these will be presented in the next section.
	\item The pre-trained model AlexNet\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} was considered for the being retrained over spectrograms, using the scheme of transfer learning.
	\item The model performance is evaluated for metrics described in the next sections. The metrics is implemented on the TorchMetrics python toolbox\footnote{\href{https://lightning.ai/docs/torchmetrics/stable}{\color{blue}https://lightning.ai/docs/torchmetrics/stable}}.

\subsection{Data Similarity}
Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence (KL divergence) has been used to measure similarities between synthetic and real datasets, and is defined as
$$D_{KL}(P||Q)=\sum_{i}P(x_i )\cdot log\left(\frac{P(x_i)}{Q(x_i)}\right)$$
where $P$ and $Q$ are the probability distributions whose distance is calculated over the samples $x_i$  of the distribution\cite{iglesias2023data}. Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence (KL divergence) is not a symmetric distance, so it can be symmetrized to give rise to the so-called Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence (JSD), defined as
$$JSD(P||Q)=D_{KL} (P||(P+Q)/2) +D_{KL}(Q||(P+Q)/2)$$
A measurement to quantify the distance between the time series distribution. It is based on calculating the Wasserstein distance between time series data. The metric is defined by measuring the Wasserstein distance of the energy between frequencies. The probability distributions have a Wasserstein‚ÄìFourier distance which is calculated as follows\cite{iglesias2023data}:
$$WF([x],[y])=W_2 (s_x,s_y)$$
where $s_x$ and $s_y$ are the normalised power spectral densities of the distributions.



\subsection{Data Augmentation}
\subsubsection{Rotation}
This transformation considers the rotation of the spectrogram around the time axis, within a given percentage range of signal length and at a given axis position. The axis position can be at the beginning, middle, or end of the spectrogram.
When applying this technique, the combination of the percentage rotation value, the location of the rotation axis, and the spectrogram of the event to which it will be applied is obtained. When generating new instances, care is taken to ensure that these three values are not repeated, thus ensuring unique instances in the dataset.
\begin{figure*}

{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/da_rotacion.png}}
\caption{Transformation by rotations, the time stretching (a) is produced when we apply the angle of rotation (b); The possible rotation axes are located at the beginning (c), center (d), and end (e) of the spectrogram, respectively. Application examples include: (f) original spectrogram, (g) 19\% rotation around the central axis, (h) 23\% rotation around the initial axis, and (i) 24\% rotation around the final axis.}
\label{fig:da_rotation}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Jittering}
Jittering is a technique for data augmentation that is utilized in time series analysis\cite{iwana2021empirical,iglesias2023data}. One of the simplest yet most effective transformation-based methods is how it is described. Jittering involves adding noise to a time series.
Mathematically, an original time series $x={x_1,...,x_t,...,x_T}$ is transformed into $x'={x_1+\epsilon_1,...,x_t+\epsilon_t,...,x_T+\epsilon_T}$ by adding noise at each time step $t$, where $\epsilon$ is typically Gaussian noise, distributed according to $N(\theta,\sigma^2)$. The standard deviation $\sigma$ of the added noise is a hyperparameter that must be predetermined\cite{iwana2021empirical}.
Jittering assumes that the time series patterns of a particular dataset are typically noisy. Sensor, audio, or electroencephalogram (EEG) data could all be included in this statement. Jittering was used with wearable sensor data for Parkinson's disease monitoring.
\begin{figure*}

\label{fig:da_jittering}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Drifting}
One issue with both online and offline settings is the drift, which is the change in the data distribution over time. Random walk is used to simulate data drift. In mathematics, a random walk is classified as a stochastic or random process that depicts a path that comprises a succession of random steps in a mathematical space, such as integers or real. The integer number line $\mathrm{Z}$ is a basic example of a random walk, which begins at $\theta$, moves $1$, or moves $-1$ with equal probability at each step. A random move of $+a$ or $-a$ with equal probability can be observed on any vector space, such as the real space. The real number $a\epsilon\mathrm{R}$ is the magnitude of the random walk\cite{fields2019mitigating}.
Let's say d defines a path starting at position $d_1=\phi(\tau)$. A random walk is modeled by the following expression:
$$d_t=d_{t-1}+\phi(\tau)$$
where $\phi$ is the random variable that describes the probability law for taking the next step and $\tau$ is the time interval between subsequent steps. Finally, an original time series $x={x_1,...,x_t,...,x_T}$ is transformed into $x\prime={x_1+d_1,...,x_t+d_t,...,x_T+d_T}$.
Drifting can be used to create more robust training data sets and make the model less sensitive or more resistant to drift when it occurs in real data.

\label{fig:da_drifting}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Genetic Algorithms}
Genetic Algorithms (GA) are described as a class within Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), inspired by the process of evolution by natural selection. Their main goal is to generate high quality solutions to problems, based on bio-inspired operators such as selection, crossover and mutation\cite{nethravathi2017augmentation}. In \cite{villegas2024data}, genetic algorithms have been applied in data augmentation on time series of centers of pressure for the detection of neuropathies.
Inspired by GA operators, a seismogram data augmentation technique was developed, which works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Selection: Involves selecting real seismograms of the same class, without repeating, to use as parents.
 \item Crossover: Combines genetic information from two or more parent seismograms to produce a new one. It involves exchanging time series segments between the parents' chromosomes.
 \item Mutation: Introducing small changes in a small proportion of the population. Here, a smoothing operation is applied to the scales of the exchanged segments.
 \item Validation: For validation, KL and JS divergences are applied to measure similarity between datasets. Values closer to zero for the KL and JS divergences indicate greater similarity in the frequency-domain power distribution between the two seismic signals.
\end{itemize}

(d) and (e) are spectrogram of parent signals. (f) Spectrogram of the generated signal with Genetic Algorithm.}
\label{fig:da_ga2}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{SpecAugment}
SpecAugment is a data augmentation technique designed for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).  Its purpose is to help the network learn useful features that are robust to certain time warping, partial loss of frequency information and partial loss of small signal segments.  It is a simple and computationally inexpensive method, since it acts directly on the log-mel spectrogram as if it were an image, which can be applied online during training\cite{park2019specaugment}.
SpecAugment policies consist of frequency masking, time masking and time warping\cite{park2020specaugment,soni2024generalized}.
We apply SpecAugment on spectrograms considering frequency and time masking policies, as well as temporal warping.

\label{fig:da_specaugment}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Interpolation AEs}
Autoencoders can interpolate in certain situations by decoding the convex combination of the latent codes of two data points and producing an output that semantically blends the features of the data points\cite{berthelot2018understanding}.
First, an input $x\epsilon\mathrm{R}^{d_x}$ is passed through an "encoder" $z=f_\theta(x)$ parametrized by $\theta$ to obtain a latent code $z\epsilon\mathrm{R}^{d_z}$. The latent code is then passed through a "decoder" $\hat{x}=g_\phi(z)$ parametrized by $\phi$ to produce an approximate reconstruction $\hat{x}\epsilon\mathrm{R}^{d_x}$ of the input $x$. We consider the case where $f_\theta$ and $g_\phi$ are implemented as multi-layer neural networks. The encoder and decoder are trained simultaneously (i.e. with respect to $\theta$ and $\phi$) to minimize some notion of distance between the input $x$ and the output $\hat{x}$, for example the squared $L_2$ distance $\left\|x-\hat{x}\right\|^2$.
Interpolating using an autoencoder describes the process of using the decoder $g_\phi$ to decode a mixture of two latent codes. Typically, the latent codes are combined via a convex combination, so that interpolation amounts to computing $x_\alpha=g_\phi(\alpha z_1+(1-\alpha) z_2)$ for some $\alpha\epsilon[0,1]$ where $z_1=f_\theta(x_1)$ and $z_2=f_\theta(x_2)$ are the latent codes corresponding to data points $x_1$ and $x_2$.

\subsection{Model performance - Metrics}
Machine Learning metrics allow you to quantify the performance of a machine learning model once it is already trained, in addition to comparing it with generated Machine Learning models and the current situation. Evaluating the Machine Learning algorithm is an essential part of any project. Most of the time we use classification accuracy to measure the performance of our model, however, it is not enough to truly judge the model, which is why different types of evaluation metrics are considered.
Among the different classification metrics, we can mention:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Confusion Matrix: Tabular display of truth labels versus model predictions. It's not exactly a performance metric, but rather a kind of basis on which other metrics evaluate results.
\begin{table}
\caption{Confusion matrix.}
\centering
\begin{tblr}{
  cell{1}{1} = {c=2,r=2}{}, cell{1}{3} = {c=2}{}, cell{3}{1} = {r=2}{},
}
\textbf{~} &  & Predicted & \\
 \hline
 &  &
  Positive~(P)
   &
  Negative~(N)
  \\
  \hline
Actual &
  Positive (P)
   & True positive (TP) & False negative (FN)\\
 &
  Negative (N)
   & False positive (FP) & True negative (TN)\\
  \hline
\end{tblr}
\label{table:confusion_matrix}
\end{table}
Where TP are true positives, TN are true negatives, FP are false positives and FN are false negatives.
 \item Recall (Sensitivity): Calculates the real quantity that the model is able to identify.
$$Recall=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$
 \item Precision: Calculates the quality of the model in classification tasks. What cases identified as real are.
$$Precision=\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$
 \item $F_\beta$: Combines precision and recall measures into a single value, making it easier to compare performance between several models. $\beta$ is a real positive factor, which gives more importance to precision than to recall if it is greater than 1. This is a metric widely used in problems in which the data set to be analyzed is unbalanced.
$$F_\beta=(1+\beta^2)\cdot \frac{precision\cdot recall}{\beta^2 \cdot precision+recall}$$
 \item Acurracy: Measures the percentage of correct cases. It usually has problems with unbalanced datasets.
$$Accuracy=\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$$
 \item Specificity: The number of genuinely negative examples that the model identified divided by the total number of negative examples in the data set.
$$Specificity=\frac{TN}{TN+FP}$$
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Evaluation metrics for data augmentation}
Data augmentation techniques have become a widely strategy adopted for improve the generalization capacity of deep neural networks. However, a very important aspect is the concepts of similarity and diversity in the data \cite{yang2024investigating}. The similarity captures the resemblance between the original and augmented data, and the diversity measure the variation in complexity between the original and augmented data.


\subsubsection{Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)}
The Fr√©chet Inception Distance is a primary metric for evaluating the quality of images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\cite{guven2024image}. The main objective of the FID is to quantify the similarity between generated and real images\cite{heusel2017gans}. It is considered an improvement over previous metrics such as the Inception Score (IS), as the FID uses statistics from real world samples for comparison, unlike the IS, which does not\cite{kynk√§√§nniemi2023roleimagenetclassesfrechet}.
The key idea behind the FID is to embed real and generated images into a vision-relevant feature space and then calculate a distance between the distributions of these two embeddings. In practice, this feature space is typically the penultimate layer (pool3, with 2048 features) of an Inception-V3 classifier network pre-trained on ImageNet\cite{kynk√§√§nniemi2023roleimagenetclassesfrechet}.
\[FID(\mu_r,\Sigma_r,\mu_g,\Sigma_g )=\left\|\mu_r-\mu_g \right\|_2^2+Tr(\Sigma_r+\Sigma_g-2(\Sigma_r \Sigma_g)^{\frac{1}{2}})\]
where $(\mu_r,\Sigma_r)$ and $(\mu_g,\Sigma_g)$ denote the sample main and covariance of the embeddings of the real and generated data, respectively, and $Tr(\cdot)$ indicates the matrix trace\cite{kynk√§√§nniemi2023roleimagenetclassesfrechet}.
The theoretical range of the FID is $[0, \infty)$, since it is a distance measure. Lower FID scores indicate better image quality\cite{wang2019improvingmmdgantrainingrepulsive}. Theoretically, an FID of 0 means that the feature distributions of the generated and real images are identical (in terms of mean and covariance according to the Gaussian approximation)\cite{heusel2017gans}.
FID has been found to correlate reasonably well with human judgments of the fidelity of generated images\cite{heusel2017gans}.


\subsubsection{Kernel Inception Distance (KID)}
The squared Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measurement is used by KID to determine the difference between the feature representations of real and generated images. The features are derived from the Inception network. Unlike the Fr√©chet Inception Distance\cite{heusel2017gans}, KID's unbiased estimator increases its reliability, particularly when there are less test images than the dimensions of the inception features. The lower KID signifies that there are more visual similarities between real and generated images\cite{kim2019ugatit}.
KID use a polynomial kernel $k(x,y)=(\frac{1}{d}x^T\cdot y+1)^3$ where d is the dimension of the Inception representation vector, and x and y are two feature vectors. The kernel $K(x,y)=k(\phi(x),\phi(y))$ can be used as an MMD for input images, and images can be converted to Inception representations through $\phi$ mapping\cite{binkowski2018demystifying}.
Since it's a distance metric, a KID value of 0 indicates a perfect match between the two feature distributions being compared (the one from the real images and the one from the generated ones). Theoretically, if the distributions are identical, the distance is zero. A key mathematical advantage of the KID is that it has a simple, unbiased estimator, unlike the FID\cite{binkowski2018demystifying}.

\subsubsection{Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM)}
MS-SSIM is a multi-scale improve version of SSIM that tries to eliminate aspects of an image that are not crucial for human perception\cite{wang2003multiscale,ma2016group}. The SSIM calculation (the basis of MS-SSIM) compares three principal components: luminance (intensity), contrast, and structure. It uses simple statistical moments such as the mean and standard deviation in local windows to obtain a similarity score.
$$MS-SSIM(x,y)=\left[l_M (x,y)\right]^{\alpha_M}\cdot \prod_{j=1}^{M}\left[c_j(x,y)\right]^{\beta_j}\cdot \left[s_j (x,y)\right]^{\gamma_j}$$
Where $l_M (x,y)$ represents the luminance component between images $x$ and $y$, $c_j(x,y)$ denotes the contrast component at scale $j$, and $s_j(x,y)$ reflects the structural similarity in scale $j$. The parameters $\alpha_M$, $\beta_j$, and $\gamma_j$ define the relative importance of the luminance, contrast, and structure components, respectively. Lastly, $M$ signifies the number of scales employed in the MS-SSIM calculation\cite{arsenio2025recovering}.
The range of MS-SSIM values is between 0 and 1, and images with higher MS-SSIM values are perceived as more similar\cite{odena2017conditional}, with 1 indicating perfect similarity. Lower MS-SSIM scores indicate higher diversity\cite{guo2019autoembedding,wang2019improvingmmdgantrainingrepulsive}.
Unlike metrics such as FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) or KID (Kernel Inception Distance), the MS-SSIM does not require a pre-trained Inception network\cite{fahim2020alightweight}. For this reason, is not recommended to use the IS, KID or FID because they already use weights from the inception network, which are valid for images similar to those in the ImageNet dataset. These metrics cannot be used as over fingerprint datasets because are not part of the ImageNet dataset\cite{fahim2020alightweight}.
FID indicate better image quality. Lower MS-SSIM scores indicate higher diversity\cite{guo2019autoembedding}. Smaller FID and KID values indicate more realistic images on image translation\cite{torbunov2023rethinking}.
Because our spectrograms dataset is not part of ImageNet dataset, we used the MS-SSIM score.

\section{Results}
We had unbalanced data, with 3\% (HY), 9\% (LP), 36\% (TC), 8\% (TR) and 44\% (VT), see Table \ref{table:lascar_statistics}. We generate new data means, data augmentation techniques such as Rotation, Jittering, Drifting, Scaling, Flipping, Genetic Algorithms, and SpecAugment. We designed a lot of experiments based on each data augmentation method (Table \ref{table:training_statistic}). Each new balanced dataset was considered for Transfer Learning with the AlexNet pre-trained model. On the other hand, we trained several models of Deep Learning, ad hoc, with new balanced datasets.

\subsection{Real}
The original unbalanced dataset of 6,145 events is considered, which was divided into the proportions of 80/20, for training and testing the model, respectively. This experiment will show the influence of an unbalanced dataset on the accuracy of the probabilistic model.
\subsection{Rotation}
The original unbalanced dataset of 6,145 events is considered, which is balanced considering rotation as a given technique, so that the number of examples of the underrepresented classes is increased, obtaining a dataset of 1.3430 events. This data set will show us the effectiveness of this technique of increasing data in the construction of the classification model.
In addition, another balanced dataset of 13,430 purely augmented events were generated, 2,686 examples for each event, for comparison purposes.
The parameters used for the rotation were in the rotation range of 5\% to 25\%, and with random rotation axis (start, center, end), without repetition.
\subsection{Jittering}
The original unbalanced dataset of 6,145 events is considered, and data augmentation is applied to the dataset to balance it by increasing examples from underrepresented classes, resulting in a dataset of 13,430 events.
The parameters used are Gaussian noise with a distribution of $N(\mu=0,\sigma=0.2)$. A balanced dataset of 13,430 events was also generated entirely from augmented data.
\subsection{Drifting}
The original unbalanced dataset of 6,145 events is considered, to which the data augmentation technique is applied in such a way that the dataset is balanced by increasing examples from underrepresented classes, resulting in a dataset of 13,430 events.
The parameters used are random values from defined real intervals $[a,b]$. A balanced dataset of 13,430 events was also generated entirely from augmented data.
\subsection{Genetic Algorithm}
Using the data augmentation technique of Genetic Algorithms, a balanced dataset of 13,430 augmented events was generated, 2,686 examples for each event. Different values of the signal proportion parameters of the parent events, as well as the number of crossing segments in the technique, are considered for the generation of the new dataset. This dataset will show the effectiveness of this data augmentation technique in building the model.
In this type of data augmentation technique, there are two variants:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Without time adjustment: It is verified that the parents can be segmented into the number of crossover segments and time; the crossover occurs at the defined times. The parameters used are three crossover segments with a time of 5 seconds each.
 \item With time adjustment: The number of crossover segments and the signal proportion to be used for the crossover are defined. The segment times are calculated proportionally for both parents.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{SpecAugment}
Using SpecAugment's data augmentation technique, a balanced dataset of 13,430 augmented events was generated, 2,686 examples for each event. This dataset will show the effectiveness of this data augmentation technique in building the model. To generate the new data set, different values of the maximum percentage parameters of each time and frequency mask were considered, in addition to the number of masks for each of them.
The parameters used are two time and frequency masks, with 10\% of the signal in each mask.

\subsection{Interpolation AEs}
This technique was used to generate a balanced dataset of 13,430 purely augmented events.
For this technique, the randomly selected parameter $\alpha\epsilon\left[0.4,0.6\right]$ was used, with a designed ad hoc convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct the interpolated signal, see Figure \ref{fig:cae_interpolation}.

The experimental evidence showed the data augmentation techniques' importance in the precision of deep learning models since models trained without considering data augmentation techniques presented low precision (Table \ref{table:training_statistic}).
For comparing our models with the state-of-art, we consider performance metrics for accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1.

\section{Discussion}
The various experiments in this research show the performance of the probabilistic model on unbalanced datasets. Specifically, dataset (i) produced a model biased towards the LP, TC and VT events (Table \ref{table:training_performance}).
It can be seen that balanced datasets generate higher performance models, since they expand the examples of the event feature space. The models were then tested on real data, showing competitive levels of classification in most cases. Transfer learning allowed deep learning models to be generated in less time (Table \ref{table:training_performance}).
In Table \ref{table:training_performance} and Table \ref{table:testing_real_dataset}. we can see that drifting data augmentation technique achieves best result in almost all of pre trained models. This can be because drifting technique covers best the data space. The best case is drifting (xi) with a drift range 0.0001 - 0.001 with an accuracy of 97.6\%, model trained over entirely augmented dataset. The next interesting result is the rotation (iii) with a range of 5\% - 25\% that achieves an accuracy of 94.2\% over another augmented dataset. In both previous cases, the F1 score metrics are similar in their accuracy respective. Although both models were generated from entirely augmented data, they show good performance in addition to the tests on real data, with accuracies of 97.2\% for (xi) and 93.7\% for (iii) (Table \ref{table:testing_real_dataset}), although the highest accuracy value is recorded in (x) with 98.3\% with real and augmented data.
It can be observed that the dataset composed of real and augmented data (x) generated by drifting in the range of 0.0001-0.001 reaches an accuracy of 93.8\%. Then the dataset of augmented data (ix) generated by drifting in range 0.001-0.01, reaches an accuracy of 93.5\%. Then we have the augmented data dataset (xxv) generated by Autoencoder Interpolation in the range 40\%-60\%, it obtains an accuracy of 93.1\% (Table \ref{table:training_performance}). These models also show good performance in tests with real data, with accuracies of 98.3\% for (x), 93.7\% for (ix) and 80.7\% for (xxv) (Table \ref{table:testing_real_dataset}). Only the last model has a large distance between training and test accuracy on real data.
To obtain a generalized dataset, data from several stations were considered to generate a multi-station generalized probabilistic model. Furthermore, it was observed that models trained with completely augmented data achieved high recognition accuracy with real data in most cases (Table \ref{table:testing_real_dataset}).
Figure \ref{fig:da_training_test} shows that drifting, rotation, interpolation, and specification have slightly better accuracy values than the other techniques. In general, the trained models perform better when tested on real data than during training.
Regarding the similarity and diversity metrics, it can be seen that the MS-SSIM values for the rotation and drifting techniques are similar, although the former shows more diversity, depending on the generation parameters (Table \ref{table:similarity_diversity_metrics}).
It can also be seen that Jittering shows higher diversity in (v) and (iv), with MS-SSIM values of 0.26 and 0.29, respectively.
The most similar are Interpolation (xxv) and Drifting (vi), with MS-SSIM values of 0.42 and 0.41, respectively.
Figure \ref{fig:da_training_msssim} shows the concentration of points in terms of the value of the MS-SSIM similarity metric vs. the accuracy of the model training. Only two distant points are seen, the dataset with only real data (i), which is distant due to having a low accuracy because it is an unbalanced dataset. Another distant point is the drifting dataset (vii) with a range of 0.01-0.1 because it shows more similarity. Zooming in on Figure \ref{fig:da_training_msssim_zoom}, it can be seen that almost all the datasets have the same level of diversity, including the real dataset, but the augmented Jittering dataset (v) presents more diversity. Comparing augmented datasets with real and augmented datasets, within the same DA method, it can be seen that the augmented datasets present more diversity and training performance with Jittering, SpecAugment (xx)(xxi), and Rotation.
In Figure \ref{fig:da_test_msssim}, some augmented and real datasets show  better diversity and testing accuracy values than the augmented datasets in the same DA method, and they are Drifting (x)(xi), rotation (ii)(iii), SpecAugment (xxii)(xxiii), Drifting (viii)(ix).

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, several data augmentation techniques have been described, developed, and applied to seismic-volcanic signals, initially considered to balance the datasets, and subsequently to generate entirely augmented datasets. Deep learning classification models have been trained on these datasets, considering transfer learning with the pre-trained AlexNet model.
The performance of the trained classification models has been evaluated, and it has been found that data augmentation techniques generate models with better performance.
It was observed that the trained classification models and the data augmentation methods considered are competitive with the baseline presented in a previous work. In addition to the following results:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The data from multiple stations on the Lascar volcano allowed us to build more generalized probabilistic models, avoiding biases by considering various data augmentation techniques.
 \item Data augmentation techniques are important for improving the performance metrics of deep learning models, as they allow for the generation of more examples within the feature space of volcanic seismic events.
 \item Similarity and diversity metrics allowed us to analyze these features in the various data augmentation techniques presented.
 \item Transfer learning helped to generate deep learning models much faster than training them from scratch.
\end{itemize}
The results of this work can be used to improve the performance of deep learning models in the recognition of seismic-volcanic signals, considering the data augmentation techniques presented. The results also show that the models trained with entirely augmented data achieve good performance in tests with real data, which is a significant contribution to the field of seismic-volcanic signal recognition.
